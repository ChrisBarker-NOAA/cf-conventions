| Description

| **`boundary_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every edge of each boundary the two nodes that it connects.  (DCH - what is "the boundary")

| **`cf_role`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| ??

| **`edge_coordinates`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Identifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of the edge (commonly the midpoint).

| **`edge_dimension`**
| I
| MT, LIS
| Identifies the dimension used to indicate the index of the edge in the connectivity arrays.

| **`edge_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying all faces that share the same edge, i. e. are neighbours to an edge. 

| **`edge_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every edge the indices of its begin and end nodes.

| **`face_coordinates`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of faces. 

| **`face_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| ??

| **`face_edge_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every face the indices of its edges.

| **`face_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying all faces that share an edge with each face, i.e. are neighbours. 

| **`face_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every face the indices of its corner nodes.

| **`location`**
| S
| LIS, D, Do
| Specifies the (stagger) location within the mesh topology that at which the variable is defined.

| **`location_index_set`**
| S
| D, Do
| Specifies a variable that defines the subset of locations of a mesh topology at which the variable is defined, e.g. only at boundary points or at special locations like weirs and gates.

| **`mesh`**
| S
| LIS, D, Do
| Specifies a variable that defines a mesh topology.

| **`node_coordinates`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables representing the node locations (latitude, longitude, or other spatial coordinates, and optional elevation or other coordinates).

| **`volume_edge_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every volume the indices of its edges. 

| **`topology_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| Indicates the highest dimensionality of the geometric elements.

| **`volume_coordinates`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of volumes. 

| **`volume_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| ??

| **`volume_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every volume the indices of its faces. 

| **`volume_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every volume the indices of its corner nodes.

| **`volume_shape_type`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies a flag variable that specifies for every volume its shape.

| **`volume_volume_connectivity`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| Specifies an index variable identifying all volumes that share a face with each volume, i.e. are neighbours.
