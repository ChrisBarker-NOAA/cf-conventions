== Mesh Topologies

The CF attributes listed here may be used to define mesh topologies
(<<mesh-topology-variables>>). This list is intended as a summary of
the attributes that have been standardized via the UGRID conventions
<<UGRID>>, which should be consulted for further details.

The "Type" values are **S** for string, and **I** for integer.
The "Use" values are **MT** for mesh topology variables, **LIS** for location index set variables, **D** for data variables, and **Do** for domain variables

| Description

| **`boundary_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every edge of each boundary the two nodes that it connects.  (DCH - what is "the boundary")

| **`cf_role`**
| S
| MT, LIS
| ??

| **`coordinates`**
| S
| LIS
| Identifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic locations of the subset of mesh topology locations.

| **`edge_coordinates`**
| S
| MT
| Identifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of the edges (commonly the midpoint).

| **`edge_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| Identifies the dimension used to indicate the index of the edge in the connectivity arrays.

| **`edge_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying all faces that share the same edge, i.e. are neighbours to an edge. 

| **`edge_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every edge the indices of its begin and end nodes.

| **`face_coordinates`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of faces. 

| **`face_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| ??

| **`face_edge_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every face the indices of its edges.

| **`face_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying all faces that share an edge with each face, i.e. are neighbours. 

| **`face_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every face the indices of its corner nodes.

| **`location`**
| S
| LIS, D, Do
| Specifies the (stagger) location within the mesh topology that at which the variable is defined.

| **`location_index_set`**
| S
| D, Do
| Specifies a variable that defines the subset of locations of a mesh topology at which the variable is defined.

| **`mesh`**
| S
| LIS, D, Do
| Specifies a variable that defines a mesh topology.

| **`node_coordinates`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables representing the node locations (latitude, longitude, or other spatial coordinates, and optional elevation or other coordinates).

| **`start_index`**
| I
| MT
| Indicates whether 0- or 1-based indexing is used to identify connected geometric elements; connectivity indices are 0-based by default.

| **`topology_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| Indicates the highest dimensionality of the geometric elements.

| **`volume_coordinates`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies the auxiliary coordinate variables associated with the characteristic location of volumes. 

| **`volume_dimension`**
| I
| MT
| ??

| **`volume_edge_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every volume the indices of its edges. 

| **`volume_face_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every volume the indices of its faces. 

| **`volume_node_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying for every volume the indices of its corner nodes.

| **`volume_shape_type`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies a flag variable that specifies for every volume its shape.

| **`volume_volume_connectivity`**
| S
| MT
| Specifies an index variable identifying all volumes that share a face with each volume, i.e. are neighbours.
